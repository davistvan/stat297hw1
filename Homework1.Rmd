My favourite hobby is snowboarding:

"An interesting fact about me is that I don't like to sleep.
Use the > character in front of a line, just like in email.
Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.
Add the >> if you want to quote within a quote."

I like to swim in the lake on summer and skiing on the mountains in winter.
Yet, my favorite season is autumn because I like to see the forests with yellow leaves and eat marrons chauds.


# Introduction
In this section we will insert a videoclip from Youtube.

## Sumary for simulations
``` {r echo = FALSE}

x <- rnorm(100)

c("median", median(x))
c("mean", mean(x))
c("variance", var(x))

```

The median is `r median(x)` \
The mean is `r median(x)` \
THe variance is `r var(x)` \



## Section 4 answer:
In our opinion the values will not be exactly 0 and 1. Our sample has values with mean of zero and variance of 1 therefore when the 100 values are randomly extracted from this distribution it makes sense that the simulation will not have exact values.



## Histogram of simulation

You can also embed plots, for example:

{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(x, col = "cyan", main = "Histogram of simulation")



##Formula
$E[var\{ v_n(\theta)} }]$
